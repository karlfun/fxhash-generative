# fxhash-generative
generative art for fxhash on tezos


This project is designed to have four layers of images called randomly. 
Currently they are set up as Background, Border, Gesture, and Texture. 

The images are transparent PNG files which are all set to be 800 x 800 pixels. 

SVG support is trickier on fxhash, but that would make the project file an even smaller size.

Replace the image names in each function set - and you can create your own project!

Could be perfect for that 10k pfp project you've been planning.
